## About the Project
This project is a **Wordle game clone** that allows users to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. It has been developed in three stages:
- **Initial Terminal Versions**: Implemented in Python (`Wordle_game_python.py`) and Java (`WordleGuessingGame.java`).
- **Browser-Based Game**: Developed using modern web technologies, including an interactive user interface.

---

## Technologies Used
### Core
- **Browser**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Terminal**: Java, Python

---

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the game locally:

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anishsaraf101/Wordle-Game
cd wordle-clone
```

### 2. Start a Local Python Server
```bash
cd browser_game
python -m http.server 8000
```
This ensures JavaScript code can open related text files.

### 3. Start a Local Python Server
Click the browser link in the terminal or copy and paste the link into a modern browser.

### 4. Load game in Terminal (Optional)
Navigate to terminal directory and type either:
```bash
python3 Wordle_game_python.py
```
OR
```bash
javac WordleGuessingGame.java
java WordleGuessingGame
```
for Python or Java implementation, respectively.

## Future Enhancements
- **UUID**: Give each unique user their own user ID to track gameplay history
- **Database**: Implement a database to store each user
- **Login System**: Optionally allow account creation for secure tracking of accounts.
